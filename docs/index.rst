Orbit
=====

Orbit is a free open-source software with the focus on quantification of big images like whole slide scans. It offers sophisticated image analysis algorithms. Of those, tissue quantification using machine learning techniques, object/cell segmentation, and object classification are the basic ones. We demonstrate how to integrate Orbit and OMERO using both the User Interface and the API.
